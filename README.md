# PyBer_Analysis

### Overview of the analysis:

The new analysis was performed to show how fares on a weekly basis differ based on city type. Using the data for rides, drivers, fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type, a line chart was created to display the differences between rural, urban and suburban fare. 

### Results:

Between January and April, urban fares were the highest per week, suburban fares were second highest and rural fares were the lowest. This is visualized in the line chart.

The ridesharing data between city type varies for each category, but overal rural ares have less rides, drivers and fares, but the average fare per ride in rural areas is $10 higher than urban areas. Thus, the average fare per driver is higher in rural areas too by $39. Suburban areas are consistenly in the middle of rural and urban areas. 

### Summary:

Rural fares are the lowest overall per week, but rural rides are more expensive, probably because people need to travel farther in rural areas. To increase ridership in rural areas, Pyber could market its services and try to get more drivers or lower fares to entice more riders. In urban areas, drivers are making much less than rural and suburban drivers, which may turn drivers away and mean there aren't enough rides in urban areas. Increasing the fare per ride in urban areas would make drivers happier and wouldn't impact riders too much, they're paying less than riders in other areas.
